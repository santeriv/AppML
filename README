It's is a modified version of AppML based of 0.9 REV005

It add support for hastag to be added to urls (not used by phonegap directly)

It add support for back button.

Use the provided index_phonegap.html as base.

Still under development to suit my need. And add more features.

I use an android phone with cyanogen 7 (android 2.3.4)
Maybe it affect the way phonegap works, maybe not.

File issues if you find any, Thanks
